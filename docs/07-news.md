## Past versions of MOSAIC



Table: (\#tab:unnamed-chunk-1)Current and future planned model versions with brief descriptions.

|Version |Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|:-------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|v0.1    |**Current:** Beta version of the model to establish mechanisms and links to data. Basic SIR dynamics with mobility, vaccination, environmental transmission, and an observation process.                     |
|v1.0    |**Future:** First implementation in LASER. Model definition is the same. Improvements to data sources and model adjustments to new data.                                                                     |
|v2.0    |**Future:** Maximizing metapopulation approach. District level data and improvements to model fitting and hierarchical likelihoods. Likely in LASER, but could still have an R implementation at this point. |
|v3.0    |**Future:** Agent-based component with better immune dynamics.                                                                                                                                               |




## The MOSAIC framework presented at ASMTH 2024 (November 25, 2024)

John Giles presented the MOSAIC modeling framework in a talk entitled "*Cholera modeling capacity at IDM:
leveraging diverse data streams for scenarios and forecasting*" at the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) on November 14, 2024 as part the symposium entitled "*Infectious Disease Surveillance and Modeling in LMICâ€™s: From Data Collection to Forecasting*".
