## Past versions of MOSAIC



Table: (\#tab:unnamed-chunk-1)Current and future planned model versions with brief descriptions.

|Version |Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|:-------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|v0.1    |**Current:** Beta version of the model to establish mechanisms and links to data. Basic SIR dynamics with mobility, vaccination, environmental transmission, and an observation process.                     |
|v1.0    |**Future:** First implementation in LASER. Model definition is the same. Improvements to data sources and model adjustments to new data.                                                                     |
|v2.0    |**Future:** Maximizing metapopulation approach. District level data and improvements to model fitting and hierarchical likelihoods. Likely in LASER, but could still have an R implementation at this point. |
|v3.0    |**Future:** Agent-based component with better immune dynamics.                                                                                                                                               |
